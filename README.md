🏫 Faculty & Student Details Manager – Python OOP
✨ Why it’s cool

Because every coder should know how to model real-world people with Python classes—and here, we do it for both faculty and students in style.

📜 What this script does

Defines two classes: Faculty and Student

Each class holds details like name, email, address, phone, date of joining, and more.

Uses an __init__ constructor to set default values.

Updates attributes manually, then displays them using a clean display() method.

Demonstrates basic OOP concepts like encapsulation and methods.
