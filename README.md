🕰️📖 The Ledger of Forgotten Names – A Python OOP Chronicle 🕰️📖
----------
🖤 Why This Isn’t Just Code

Every institution has two tribes: the ones who teach, and the ones who obey.
But beneath their names, emails, and joining dates… lies something far darker:
A record that time itself cannot erase.

This script isn’t just Python OOP.
It’s a ledger. A mirror. A haunting archive of lives reduced to attributes.

Faculty. Student. Master. Disciple.
Roles we inherit, roles we abandon.
And the machine records them all — without mercy.
-------
📜 What This Script Does (Behind the Veil)

Defines two entities trapped in code: Faculty and Student.

Each carries their identity papers: name, email, address, phone, date of joining.

A constructor (__init__) whispers their details into existence.

Attributes are altered manually — as if fate itself edits our lives.

A display() method exposes them, raw and unhidden,
like gravestones lined up in digital silence.

This is Object-Oriented Programming…
but it reads like a database of souls.

Each line is more than data.
It’s a confession.
A life reduced to strings and integers.
One day, your own name may appear here — and no method will delete it.

🚀 Try It Out (If You Dare)

Clone this repo.
Run the script.

Watch as your Python classes come alive with names, salaries, and dates.
But remember: the more you run it, the more you realize—

You aren’t coding them.
You’re cataloguing yourself.
